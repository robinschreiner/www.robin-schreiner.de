## Intro

In 2019 Frank, a prominent figure in the pension and insurance industry and the founder of a young startup, contacted us to help him bring his startup to live. The goal was to make employee benefits more accessible and show them all on one platform. He planned to revolutionize the company pension industry. With their combined experience and determination, they aimed to provide an innovative app that would have revolutionized the way employers and employees interacted and collaborated.

## The Challenges

From Franks extensive industry knowledge and a lot of feedback from the industry leaders, they discovered, that there are two key main challenges for the company pension industry and the overall labour market for companies.

### For HR-Departments:

#### War for talent is intensifying, companies invest a lot but employee appreciation lags

Companies face the difficulty of attracting and retaining skilled workers due to a growing shortage in the talent pool. They are investing significant amounts into benefits like corporate pension schemes, with a desire to provide appreciation through valuable benefits for their employees. However those efforts are not really recognized by the employees and they don’t really feel appreciation. They also have a lot of manual processes in personnel administration.

### For the insurance industry:

#### Incredibly poor closing rates

Pension products have incredibly poor closing rates of only 36 % for pension products despite the crucial need for employees to take care of their pension. They also suffer lack of young talents in sales and loose touchpoints to private customers.

---

### For the employees:

#### A desperate need for a pension solution

14,000,000 employees (in SMEs) are in a desperate need for a pension solution, but 64% still have no contract with their employer as they hate complexity in pension products and do not understand the benefits of a retirement provision.

# The Idea

The idea was born to combine all benefits a company offers on one easy usable platform and to make the benefits of for example the company pension more transparent for the employees to generate a feeling of appreciation and at the same time digital transform hr processes.

# Design & UX Process

The design and UX process began with a series of workshops, including the first Design Thinking Workshop, which involved user research to validate the problem, empathy mapping and personas to understand the target audience, ideation sessions, creating paper prototypes, conducting user interviews, and using Marvel App and InVision for visualization.

Following that, a Business Design Workshop was conducted, which included market research to assess market demand and identify potential paying customers, the development of a business model, the creation of a value proposition, and conducting a SWOT analysis.

Throughout the design and UX phase, customer involvement was crucial. This involved various activities such as field studies, beta testing, adopting early power users, conducting moderated testing sessions, cognitive walkthroughs, remote and in-place usability testing, expert reviews, stakeholder interviews, co-creation workshops, surveys and questionnaires, content audits, contextual inquiries, customer journey mapping, and user journey mapping. User behavior analytics and usability metrics were implemented to gather insights. Additionally, a design system and style guides were developed, and various design activities were performed, including sketching, creating low-fidelity and high-fidelity wireframes, interactive prototyping, and visual branding encompassing the logo and all assets. The design process was iterative, starting with Sketch and later migrating to Figma.

## Results

## Key Learnings & Conclusion

## My Role

In my initial role, I was the responsible Project Manager and Business Analyst. As we already had a lot of customer feedback and market research from Frank, I conducted two design sprints with my team to validate the idea and accelerate the design process for this specific challenge. After successfully testing the resulting prototyp with customers, I conducted a business model workshop using tools and frameworks such as the Business Model Canvas, Value Proposition Canvas, SWOT analysis, Personas. In the and we had a business strategy, documentation and action plan including the definition of an MVP.

Starting from there, together with my design team, we developed the brand language and all brand assets as well as first layouts and user flows for the be+ Development Team.

After that I joined be+ fulltime as Head of Product and continued to provide strategic direction for the be+ App. This involved developing the overall strategy, translating it into a comprehensive product roadmap as well as taking ownership of it.

I was also responsible for preparing tasks as user stories, coordinating the development team, and moderating the Scrum process. Additionally, I conducted market observation to identify trends and conducted user research, covering all aspects related to UX.

Furthermore, I created, governed, and maintained the design system to ensure consistency and efficiency in collaboration with external partners.
In my day-to-day I was also designing all components, interfaces, user flows and enhanced the overall user experience.

I also handled marketing and social media activities and identified potential synergy effects with other products or partners.

In addition to these responsibilities, I undertook advanced frontend tasks related to CSS and templating, addressing complex visual elements and optimising the app’s frontend performance.
Throughout the project, I encountered various constraints. These included coordinating the design for multiple platforms, including mobile and desktop, managing mixed teams with language barriers, working with a small team that lacked internal developers, and supporting a founder with limited IT knowledge. Moreover, the project operated within the context of a complicated and highly regulated market involving insurances and HR processes.
