## Challenge

The client, be+, was a young startup that hadn’t even been legally founded yet but had aspirations for the future. Led by Frank, a prominent figure in the pension and insurance industry with a substantial background in banking and finance leadership, they were planning to enter the HR Benefits & Company Pension industry. Frank’s extensive expertise and industry knowledge positioned him as a key player in driving the startup’s vision forward. With their combined experience and determination, they aimed to provide an innovative app that would have revolutionized the way employers and employees interacted and collaborated.\*

## The Problem

be+ was founded to solve two key challenges.

1. Firstly, companies are investing significant amounts into corporate pension schemes, with a desire to provide valuable benefits for their employees.
   However those efforts are not really recognized by the employees and they don’t really feel appreciation.

2. Secondly, and at the same time, they faced the difficulty of attracting and retaining skilled workers due to a growing shortage in the talent pool.

It was crucial to solve this problem because the competition for talented individuals was becoming increasingly fierce, intensifying the war for talent.
And companies were under rising pressure to manage costs, pricing, and overall efficiency, making it important to tackle these challenges fast.

## My Role

In my role, I was hired to provide strategic direction for the be+ App. This involved developing the overall strategy and translating it into a comprehensive product roadmap as well as taking ownership of it.
I was responsible for preparing tasks as user stories, coordinating the development team, and moderating the Scrum process. Additionally, I conducted market observation to identify trends and conducted user research, covering all aspects related to UX.

Furthermore, I created, governed, and maintained the design system to ensure consistency and efficiency in collaboration with partners.
In my day-to-day I was also designing UI interfaces and user flows to enhance the overall user experience. I also handled marketing and social media activities and identified potential synergy effects with other products or partners. Building the brand language and all brand assets was another important aspect of my role.

In addition to these responsibilities, I undertook advanced frontend tasks related to CSS and templating, addressing complex visual elements and optimising the app’s frontend performance.
Throughout the project, I encountered various constraints. These included coordinating the design for multiple platforms, including mobile and desktop, managing mixed teams with language barriers, working with a small team that lacked internal developers, and supporting a founder with limited IT knowledge. Moreover, the project operated within the context of a complicated and highly regulated market involving insurances and HR processes.

## Design & UX Process

The design and UX process began with a series of workshops, including the first Design Thinking Workshop, which involved user research to validate the problem, empathy mapping and personas to understand the target audience, ideation sessions, creating paper prototypes, conducting user interviews, and using Marvel App and InVision for visualization.

Following that, a Business Design Workshop was conducted, which included market research to assess market demand and identify potential paying customers, the development of a business model, the creation of a value proposition, and conducting a SWOT analysis.

Throughout the design and UX phase, customer involvement was crucial. This involved various activities such as field studies, beta testing, adopting early power users, conducting moderated testing sessions, cognitive walkthroughs, remote and in-place usability testing, expert reviews, stakeholder interviews, co-creation workshops, surveys and questionnaires, content audits, contextual inquiries, customer journey mapping, and user journey mapping. User behavior analytics and usability metrics were implemented to gather insights. Additionally, a design system and style guides were developed, and various design activities were performed, including sketching, creating low-fidelity and high-fidelity wireframes, interactive prototyping, and visual branding encompassing the logo and all assets. The design process was iterative, starting with Sketch and later migrating to Figma.
