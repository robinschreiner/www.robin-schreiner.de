subtitle: Enabling Restaurants to offer delivery and take-away without the need for a own website.
description: The idea was to help out our local eateries during the pandemic, but we weren't really keen on relying solely on delivery services. Unfortunately, some of our go-to spots didn't have the means to do their own deliveries. So, I thought of creating a hub for hungry folks to easily find nearby restaurants, while also sparing these restaurants the trouble of having to manage their own websites (if they even have one).

## Challenge

Design a logo to help the winter sports and outdoor outlet in Herzogenaurach stand out in a competitive market next to Adidas, Puma, and Sport Hofmann. The logo should appeal to active and adventurous individuals who want to save money, increase brand awareness, and strengthen the brand's reputation as a leading retailer of winter sports and outdoor gear in the Herzogenaurach area.

## Concept & Progress

The process began with pencil drawings on post-its to explore different ideas and concepts. From there, I moved on to larger sketches on DIN A4 paper. We arrived at three different logo variations and one final favorite.

## Design Process

I vectorized the images to create digital versions of the logo. During this phase, I worked closely with the client to try out different color schemes, experimenting with various combinations of natural colors and neon hues to draw attention to the brand. By involving potential clients, I gathered valuable insights that helped me refine the designs and effectively communicate the client's brand identity. After several iterations, we settled on a color scheme that effectively communicated the brand's identity and would stand out in the competitive market.

From there we decided on one final draft and finetuned the details, typo and shape.

And ét voila... we had a final logo that was produced as a large eye catcher on the outlet building and was used inside for printworks, social media and website.
