## Plan and Prepare for Your Meeting.

### Define the Purpose of the Meeting

Before you can plan and prepare for an effective remote meeting, you need to first define the purpose of the meeting. What is the goal of the meeting? What do you hope to accomplish? Once you have a clear understanding of the purpose of the meeting, you can begin to plan and prepare accordingly.

### Choose the Right Format

There are a variety of different formats that you can use for a remote meeting, and not all formats will be equally effective for every situation. You’ll need to choose a format that is best suited to the purpose of your meeting and the needs of your participants. For example, if you’re holding a training session, a lecture format may be more appropriate than a roundtable discussion.

### Create a Detailed Agenda

An agenda is an essential tool for ensuring that your remote meeting is productive and efficient. The agenda should be concise and clearly outline the topics to be covered in the meeting, as well as who is responsible for each topic. It’s also important to leave time for open discussion and questions from participants.

### Send Preparatory Materials in Advance

If there are any preparatory materials that participants will need in order to fully participate in the meeting, it’s important to send them out in advance. This could include readings, slides, or any other relevant materials. Sending out preparatory materials ahead of time will allow participants to come into the meeting prepared and ready to contribute.

### Make the Most of Technology.

Choose the Right Video Conferencing Platform
When choosing a video conferencing platform for your remote meeting, it’s important to consider the specific needs of your team and the goals of your meeting. For example, if you’re looking for a platform that offers features like screen sharing and recording, Zoom would be a good option. If you need a platform that’s more focused on collaboration, Google Hangouts might be a better fit. There are many different platforms available, so take some time to research which one will work best for your team.

### Test Your Equipment in Advance

It’s important to test your equipment in advance of your remote meeting to ensure that everything is working properly. This includes testing your microphone, webcam, and internet connection. If you’re using a laptop or desktop computer, make sure that the camera is positioned correctly and that there’s enough light so that participants can see you clearly. If you’re using a mobile device, test the battery life and make sure you have a strong internet connection.

### Use a Virtual Whiteboard

A virtual whiteboard can be a great way to engage participants in a remote meeting. It allows everyone to see the same information at the same time and makes it easy to brainstorm ideas or collaborate on projects. There are plenty of free options available online, such as Google Docs or Padlet. Simply create a blank document or canvas and share the link with participants before the meeting starts.

## Engage Your Remote Participants.

### Encourage Open Communication

Open communication is key to keeping remote participants engaged. Encourage questions and open discussion throughout the meeting, and provide opportunities for everyone to contribute.

### Use Visual Aids

Visual aids can help maintain focus and interest during long or complex meetings. Use slides, diagrams, infographics, or other visual aids to supplement your presentation.

### Encourage Participation

There are several ways to encourage participation in remote meetings:

- Use breakout rooms for small group discussion
- Use polls and surveys
- Encourage people to use the chat function
- Take breaks often to give people a chance to move around and stretch

## Follow Up After the Meeting.

### Send a Meeting Recap

After the meeting, it’s important to follow up with a recap. This should include a summary of what was discussed and decided, as well as any action items that were assigned. Send this recap to all participants, so everyone is on the same page and knows what needs to be done.

### Follow Up on Action Items

Make sure to follow up on any action items that were assigned during the meeting. This will ensure that tasks are actually getting done and that everyone is held accountable for their responsibilities. Assign someone to each task and set a deadline for completion. Then, follow up periodically to make sure everything is on track.

## Conclusion

First, plan and prepare for your meeting by defining its purpose, choosing the right format, creating a detailed agenda, and sending preparatory materials in advance. Second, make the most of technology by choosing the right video conferencing platform, testing your equipment in advance, and using a virtual whiteboard.
