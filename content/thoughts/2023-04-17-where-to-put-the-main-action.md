title: Top, Bottom, Right or Left? Where to put the Main Action?
description: My thoughts on one of the all-time favorite discussion topics of UX Designers â€“ OK / Cancel or Cancel / OK.
---

I just saw an interesting (design) question from Maximilian Dahl:

> Should the button with the main action be at the top or bottom?

## Different philosophies

I've encountered this question in every design project of mine. And behold... not only designers, but also Google, Microsoft, and Apple have different philosophies on this.

### Apple

typically places "Cancel" on the left side and "OK" or "Confirm" on the right side.
Apple's design principles (HIG) recommend placing the positive action on the right side.

### Microsoft

traditionally has "OK" on the left side and "Cancel" on the right side. However, this varies in different versions of Windows.

### Google

generally follows the same arrangement as Apple, with "Cancel" on the left side and the positive action on the right.

## My two cents

I have had good experiences with the Apple way, but designing dialogues and modals based on the conventions and guidelines of the respective operating system is a very exciting approach.

However, it is often much more relevant to provide button labels with descriptions that explain what they do, rather than using a generic label (such as "OK"). An explicit label serves as just-in-time help and gives users more confidence in selecting the right action.

But as always, it is important to test and validate with your own users and your usecase. ðŸ˜‰
