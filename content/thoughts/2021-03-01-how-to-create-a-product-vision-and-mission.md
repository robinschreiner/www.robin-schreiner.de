## How to create a product vision and mission.

### Step 1: Define your product

The first step in creating a product vision and mission is to define your product. What are you selling? Who is your target market? What needs does your product meet? Once you have answers to these questions, you can move on to the next step.

### Step 2: Define your target market

Now that you know what your product is, it’s time to define your target market. Who are you selling to? What are their needs and wants? What are their demographics? Knowing who your target market is will help you create a more focused product vision and mission.

### Step 3: Determine what you want your product to achieve

Now it’s time to set some goals for your product. What do you want it to achieve? Do you want it to be the best in its category? Do you want it to revolutionize the industry? Do you want it to be profitable? Setting goals for your product will help you create a more specific and achievable vision and mission.

### Step 4: Write your product vision and mission

Now that you know what your product is, who your target market is, and what you want it to achieve, it’s time to write your vision and mission statement. Keep it short, sweet, and simple. Be as specific as possible while still being realistic. And make sure it aligns with your overall business strategy.

## How to keep your product vision and mission top of mind.

### Step 1: Display your product vision and mission

A product vision and mission statement should be prominently displayed in your office or workspace. This will serve as a constant reminder of what you are working towards and why your product exists.

### Step 2: Refer to your product vision and mission often

It is not enough to simply display your product vision and mission. You should also be referring to it often, during team meetings, one-on-ones, and other occasions. This will help keep it top of mind for everyone on your team.

### Step 3:Make sure your team is aware of your product vision and mission

Your team should be aware of the product vision and mission, even if they are not directly involved in the creation of the product. This can be accomplished by sharing the vision and mission during team meetings, writing it down in an easily accessible place, or sending out periodic reminders.

## Conclusion

A product vision and mission can be extremely beneficial to a company or individual. By having a clear understanding of what they want their product to achieve, they can set themselves apart from the competition and better serve their target market. Additionally, it is important to keep the product vision and mission top of mind in order to ensure that it is always at the forefront of decision making.
