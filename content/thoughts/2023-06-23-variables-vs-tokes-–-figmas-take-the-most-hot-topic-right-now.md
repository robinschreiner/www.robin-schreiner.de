title: Variables vs. Tokes – Figmas take the most hot topic right now.
description: It seems that every one is talking about nothing else than Design
  Tokens for the last two years. As Design Systems and tokenization gained
  massiv in popularity, everybody expected the current place to be - Figma - to
  present the integration of design tokens and processes in their latest Config
  Conference. But, in the end, everyone was just confused...

F﻿igma surprised (almost) everyone by releasing the [beta of so-called variables](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/15336833927191-What-s-new-at-Config-2023#Variables_open_beta) with modes.  S﻿o, no Design Tokens? Or is Variables just their name for Design Tokens? And what are modes? 

## Design Tokens Definition

I﻿ try to bring some light into the discussion and show why my first disappointment developed into excitement for all the possibility that come up. Right now, Design Tokens are in the process to get a W3C specification. The Design Tokens Community Group's goal is to provide standards upon which products and design tools can rely for sharing stylistic pieces of a design system at scale.

> Design tokens are indivisible pieces of a design system such as colors, spacing, typography scale.\
> Sharing design properties such as a color palette across many tools and platforms should be simple.\
> The Design Tokens Community Group goal is to provide standards upon which products and design tools can rely for sharing stylistic pieces of a design system at scale.

F﻿igma describes Variables like this:

> Variables in Figma design store reusable values that can be applied to all kinds of design properties and prototyping actions. They help save time and effort when building designs, managing design systems, and creating complex prototyping flows.

S﻿o, basically they are Design Tokes. But why did Figma not just simply follow the DTCGs new Standard? They said, that they don't want to call them that way because they do not have implemented the standard completely and want to prevent confusion - well done.

## Difference in day-to-day

O﻿key, so Figma called Design Tokes the other way around. Where is the difference when working with it in my layouts?
